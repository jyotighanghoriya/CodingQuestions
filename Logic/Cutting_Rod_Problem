Maximise number of cuts in a rod if it can be cut only in given 3 sizes

Input: N = 17, A = 10, B = 11, C = 3 
Output: 3 
Explanation: 
The maximum cut can be obtain after making 2 cut of length 3 and one cut of length 11. 
Input: N = 10, A = 9, B = 7, C = 11 
Output: -1 
Explanation: 
It is impossible to make any cut so output will be -1. 

The first thing to keep in mind is -> either the cut will be possible or the cut will not be possible
Algorithm :
make the cut and see if you are getting a positive, negative or 0 value
-> If you are getting a negative value that means the cut is not possible further.
-> If you get a positive value that means cut is possible then try dividing it further
-> If you get a 0 value that means no further cuts are possible but you got the cut.

int maxCuts(int N,int a,int b, int c){
    if(N==0)
        return 0;
    if(N<0){
        return -1;
    }
    int res=max(maxCuts((N-a,a,b,c),
                maxCuts(N-b,a,b,c),
                maxCuts(N-c,a,b,c));
        if(res == -1)
            return -1;
        else
            res=res+1;
}

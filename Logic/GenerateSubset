Recursive program to generate power set
Given a set represented as a string, write a recursive code to print all subsets of it. The subsets can be printed in any order. 

Examples:  

Input :  set = "abc"
Output : "", "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", "abc"

Input : set = "abcd"
Output : "" "a" "ab" "abc" "abcd" "abd" "ac" "acd"
         "ad" "b" "bc" "bcd" "bd" "c" "cd" "d" 


Logic: 
Either you include the character or you do not include the character

void subsetsGeneration(string s,string curr,int i){
    if(i==s.length()){
        cout<<curr;
        return ;
    }
    subsetsGeneration(s,curr,i+1);
    subsetsGeneration(s,curr+s[i],i+1);
}

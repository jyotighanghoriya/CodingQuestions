Check whether a particular string is a palindrome or not.

Recursion:
When we say a string is a palindrome that means if you read the string from beginning or end. It will be same.

-> Lets think of tackling it through divide and conquer.
-> For solving divide and conquer we can solve it either using recursion or iteration.
-> lets see how we can solve it through recursion.

Logic:
-> check for 2 things:
    1. check whether the end points character are similar
    2. Check if string leaving those two characters is similar or not.

    Note:
    Base Condition:
        -> if the string length becomes 0 or 1 during division then that means that string is a palindrome. Because if string is not palindrome it will never become 0 or 1 coz there might be distinct characters when end point characters will be compared.

Pseudo code:
bool isPalindrome(string s,int start,int end){
    if(start>=end){ // Base case
        return True;
    }
    //If characters are similar then I would want to divide string further. If characters are not similar I would want to return -1 or False.
    return (s[start]==s[end])&&isPalindrome(s,start+1,end-1);
}


Variation:
Sum of Digit is Pallindrome or not 
Given a number N.Find if the digit sum(or sum of digits) of N is a Palindrome number or not.
Note:A Palindrome number is a number which stays the same when reversed.Example- 121,131,7 etc.

Algo:
1> Calculate digit sum of no. = O(n)
2> Check the obtained no. is a palindrome.

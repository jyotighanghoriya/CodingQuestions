Given a string our job is to find all the permutations of a string.
i/p: abc
o/p: abc,acb,bac,bca,cba,cab

To find permutations of all strings .. all you have to do is fix the characters consecutively and swap the remaining characters.
  if(index==str.length()-1){// check if the character one less than the required character are fixed.
        cout<<str<<endl;
        return;
    }
    for(int i=index;i<n;i++){
        swap(str[i],str[index]); // swap the character with the last character
        permutation(str,n,index+1); // call the permuatation of character.
        swap(str[i],str[index]);
    }
